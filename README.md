<h2>Q&A</h2>
<p><b>How is the Love Couple determined?</b></br>
There are two types of Love Couples. With a probability of 66.6% the pair consists of two Crewmates.</br> The second type occures with a chance of 33.3% and pairs an Impostor with a Crewmate.</p>
<p><b>What does happen in this situation (Imposter + Crewmate, Impostor, Crewmate)?</b></br>
The game does <b>not</b> end. Depending on the next kill the Love Couple or Impostors win</p>
<p><b>Can you play Proximity Chat (Crewlink) with it?</b></br>
Yes Crewlink does support Among Us Modifications.</p>
<p><b>Can you get banned for playing on public servers?</b></br>
At the current state of the game there is no perma ban system. The mod is designed in a way, that it does not send prohibited server requests.
You are also able to join your own custom server to be safe <a href="https://github.com/Impostor/Impostor">(Impostor)</a></p>
<p><b>How can i join a custom server?</b></br>
Go to your game directory and open BepInEx/config/org.bepinex.plugins.CustomServer.txt. There you can set the hostname or IP of the server. Then set the server region to CUSTOM.</p>

Yes. Every player in the game lobby has to install it.</p>
